# Bud_chatbot
Bud is a chatbot which is created bu using Tensorflow(Python) and implementing Deep Learning model. I have used NLTK which is an ML library for word preprocessing and it can be trained for higher accuracy and for various different types of questions as well and for that you will just have to add more data to the "intents.json" file which is its database used for training.
